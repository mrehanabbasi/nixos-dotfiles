## Pattern

- Always follow Dentritric pattern.
- Never use file paths but instead use module names for module references.

## Verify the target first

- Before making changes, identify the exact target config and the host required to validate it.
- Do not assume the edited path name matches the flake output or the machine that must run the verification command.
- State this explicitly before editing: `Target config: <name>. Validation host: <machine/host>. Planned verification: <command>.`

## Prefer upstream fixes

- If an issue appears to come from upstream, first check whether it is already fixed upstream.
- If the repo uses flakes, update the relevant flake input first. If the repo does not use flakes, update the channel first.
- If the fix is not in the pinned version, prefer an upstream PR commit or a commit already merged upstream before writing a local patch.
- If the repo has its own nixpkgs fork, ask whether the change should be made there and consumed by commit hash instead of patching locally.
- Only write a local patch when those options fail. Keep it minimal and put it in a separate file named `{package}-path-{fix-reason}.nix`.

## Always validate with eval

- After every Nix change, run a matching `nix eval` against the exact target output before claiming success.
- When practical, follow eval with the matching dry-run/build/test command. Eval is the minimum bar, not the whole test plan.
- `nix flake check` can also be used for validation.

## Avoid Destructive Changes

- `nix run` or `nixos-switch` are destructive and you should always confirm with user before running it.

**Note:** NEVER RUN `nixos-rebuild switch` COMMAND under any circumstances. It will be done by the user.
