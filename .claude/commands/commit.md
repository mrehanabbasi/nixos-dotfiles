description: Create a conventional commit message for staged changes
---

Use the commit-message skill to draft a **Conventional Commit** message for all staged / proposed changes. Include:
- Type (feat, fix, docs, chore, etc.)
- Scope (e.g., nixos, hyprland, docs)
- Subject & body with rationale / test list

Use the nixos-builder skill to execute this.
